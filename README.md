# Linked-List
It is related to all operations and implementations related to linked list
In which we can add data to node using insertion function (I have seperately created this function for ease) and yeah deletion as well if we want .
This is another option of displaying data through which we can also see the affectedd parts in the chain.You can modify these functions accordingly later as per your convenience.
And, that's it . Thank you :)
